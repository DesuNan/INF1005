                        <p>Eleanor Hayes had always been passionate about education. From a young age, she found joy in learning and sharing knowledge with others. Her journey in education began when she started tutoring her classmates in high school, and it continued through college and into her professional life. After obtaining her degree in education, Eleanor spent 15 fulfilling years teaching in various schools, watching her students grow and flourish under her guidance.
                            However, as she progressed in her career, Eleanor noticed a concerning trend among her students. Many of them struggled to thrive in traditional classroom settings. Some were held back by rigid curriculums, while others faced obstacles such as bullying or lack of resources. Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling that there had to be a better way to provide quality education to all youths, regardless of their circumstances.
